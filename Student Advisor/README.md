## 1. Student Advisor

#### A university has started a student-advisor plan which assigns a professor as an advisor to each student for academic guidance. Write a query to find the roll number and names of students who either have a male advisor with a salary of more than 15,000 or a female advisor with a salary of more than 20,000.

#### There are two tables in the database: student_information and faculty_information. The primary key of student information is roll number whereas that of faculty information is employee ID.
