## 2. Country Codes

#### A company wants to contact each of its customers regarding the policy changes. They have international customers, but their database does not include country codes with their phone numbers:
#### There are two tables in the database: customers and country codes. The first table contains details of every customer including customer_id, name, phone_number, and country. The second table contains the country code for every country.

#### Write a query to retrieve a list of all customer ids, names, and phone numbers, with their country codes concatenated with their phone numbers. Sort the output in the order of their customer_id.

##### Note: The phone number should be in the following format: COUNTRY CODE, PHONE NUMBER (without spaces)
